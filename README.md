### What I've Learned in This Project
- JS: 

  Array.from() - transforms array-like objects to an Arraylist so that forEach can loop through the item list. 
  
  [].filter.call() - filters and selects all panels that are not currently clicked on, and then we can transfer the "active tag" to the currently selected panel.
  
- CSS:
  
  text-shadow
